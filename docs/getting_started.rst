Getting Started
===============

1. Install `OpenBabel <http://openbabel.org/wiki/Category:Installation>`_
3. Install `GNINA <https://github.com/gnina/gnina>`_. It's best to install GNINA from source, but you can use the `pre-compiled binary <https://github.com/gnina/gnina/releases/>`_ for docking if you do not care to have GPU acceleration.
3. Clone this repository
4. `cd` into the cloned repository and run `pip install .`. This will install all remaining dependencies.
