Getting Started
===============

1. Install [OpenBabel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Category:Installation)
2. Install [RDKit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit). This is most easily done by using anaconda (`conda install rdkit -c conda-forge`), but you can also install from source if you would like.
3. Install [Gnina](https://github.com/gnina/gnina). It's best to install GNINA from source, but you can use the pre-compiled binary for docking if you do not care to have GPU acceleration.
3. Clone this repository
4. `cd` into the cloned repository and run `pip install .`. This will install any remaining dependencies.
